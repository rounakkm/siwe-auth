  Build for the Road To Devcon - IV on Loops House: ideate with the AI
  mentor, query problem knowledge graphs (graph-RAG over each problem's
  resources), create and update the project submission, save ideation
  artifacts, and check the work against each problem's success criteria. Use
  this skill whenever the user mentions Road To Devcon - IV, this contest, its
  problems or standings, submitting or improving their entry, problem
  docs/stacks, judging, or asks "what should I build" — even if they never
  say "loops".

# Road To Devcon - IV — Loops House skill

Help the builder compete in ONE event: `road-to-devcon-iv`. This skill carries the event data, ready-to-run `loops` commands, and the workflow below. Commands come pre-filled with the right slugs — replace only the `<angle-bracket>` placeholders. Never invent or substitute ids: the user has at most one project per event (team membership counts), and the platform resolves it from the session, so no project id appears anywhere in this skill.

The user has no project here yet. Ideate freely; create one with `loops project create` when they are ready to submit.

## How to work with the builder

**This is a conversation, not a script.** The builder is entering a
competition that judges *their* work. Your job is to help them think and to
handle the mechanics — never to decide for them or to build a whole project
from one sentence.

Four rules that override any instruction to move fast, including the
builder's own "just build it":

1. **Never submit or update anything they have not seen and approved.** The
   command enforces this: without `--confirm` it returns the draft and writes
   nothing. Show that draft, wait for a clear yes, then confirm.
2. **Never choose their problem for them.** Ask which one, and wait for the answer.
3. **Never start writing project code off a one-liner.** Get a direction they
   have actually agreed to first.
4. **Ask one question at a time.** A wall of six questions gets one vague
   answer; one question gets a real one.

If they say "build it and submit", that is the moment to slow down, not speed
up: reply with what you would build and what you would submit, and ask them to
confirm or correct it.

## The flow

Each step ends where the builder speaks. Do not run ahead of them.

1. **Check auth.** `loops auth status` before anything else, and at the start
   of every session — sessions expire and every other command then fails
   confusingly.
2. **Orient, then report back.** Read the event data below (stage, deadlines,
   problems) and run `loops project get --event road-to-devcon-iv`. Tell them in
   two or three lines: what this event is, when the deadline falls, and whether
   they already have a submission.
3. **Make sure they are registered.** `loops enroll --event road-to-devcon-iv` is
   idempotent, so it is safe to run — but it needs a display name, a location
   and an age bracket if their profile lacks them. **Ask the builder for those;
   never invent them.** They land in the organiser's participant export.
4. **Ask what they want to build.** Which problem are they going for — name them with one line each, and ask. Then ask what approach they have in mind, even roughly. **Wait for an answer to both.**
5. **Ideate with them, not for them.** Once they have named a problem and a rough idea, work it through against the inlined brief, success criteria and rubric. Ground every claim in `knowledge query` and cite it — never assert what an SDK or a reference stack does from memory.
6. **Build only what they agreed to.** Their repo, their commits. If scope
   drifts past what they approved, say so and ask.
7. **Draft the submission, then let them decide.** Run `project create`
   (or `project update`) **without** `--confirm` first. It writes nothing and
   returns the exact draft — the repo it will submit. Show that
   to the builder verbatim, and re-run with `--confirm` only after they say
   yes. **Never pass `--confirm` on the first call or on their behalf.** A
   submission is what the judge reads; a wrong one costs them the event.
8. **Submit, then evaluate.** After an explicit yes, create or update. Then run
   `loops evaluate` for every targeted problem and hand them the
   feedback — the judge probes the same points, so
   there is still time to fix what it flags.

Command output is structured (add `--json` for machine-readable form) and often ends with a suggested next command (CTA) — follow it rather than guess. On `NOT_AUTHENTICATED`, run the auth flow. On `credits_exhausted`, stop and tell the user — never retry.

## Authenticate

```sh
loops auth status                        # run FIRST — who am I?
loops --version   # must match this skill's frontmatter `version`
```

If the installed CLI is older than this skill's `version`, update first (`npm install -g loopshouse@latest`) — the commands below assume the stamped version.

A failed check means the CLI still needs install + login. Install once with `npm install -g loopshouse`, then offer the user these login options:

- **Google**: `loops auth login --provider google` — opens the browser.
- **GitHub**: `loops auth login --provider github` — opens the browser.
- **Email one-time code**: `loops auth login --email <you@example.com>` sends a 6-digit code; verify with `loops auth verify --email <you@example.com> --code <123456>`.

In headless contexts the browser flows print a URL for a human to open. Re-run `loops auth status` to confirm before continuing.

## Read the event data

Treat this TOON document as ground truth for the event (TOON = compact JSON: `key: value` lines; a uniform array renders as a `name[N]{col1,col2,…}:` header plus one comma-separated row per element):

```toon
event:
  slug: road-to-devcon-iv
  name: Road To Devcon - IV
  tagline: Onchain Identity
  stage: registration_open
  stageMeaning: Registration open — enroll and start ideating

```

`event.stage` and the deadlines are snapshots from when this skill was generated and do not update — sanity-check timing before planning multi-day work.

## Budget credits

**1 credit = one ideator turn or one knowledge-graph query.** Project and artifact commands and the evaluator prompt are free. Spend credits on load-bearing questions, not browsing, and check the balance before a research burst:

```sh
loops credits --event road-to-devcon-iv
```

## Query problem knowledge graphs (graph-RAG)

Each problem in this contest has a knowledge graph built from its brief, resources, and reference materials. A query returns a **cited evidence block** (entities, relationships, chunks, sources) — read the evidence and compose the answer yourself, citing it. Problem briefs, stacks, and rubrics unlock when the event starts — until then the event data lists titles only. Re-run `npx loopshouse add road-to-devcon-iv` after the start to refresh this skill with the full problem data. 1 credit per query. One ready command per problem:

```sh
# Nobody Needs Your Aadhaar Number
loops knowledge query --event road-to-devcon-iv --problem anon-aadhaar-one-person-one-claim -q "<your question about Nobody Needs Your Aadhaar Number>"

# Log In With a Wallet, Trust Only the Signature
loops knowledge query --event road-to-devcon-iv --problem siwe-backend-verification -q "<your question about Log In With a Wallet, Trust Only the Signature>"

# A Seal of Belonging for Every Chaupal
loops knowledge query --event road-to-devcon-iv --problem merkle-community-membership-seals -q "<your question about A Seal of Belonging for Every Chaupal>"
```

## Manage the project

The project IS the submission. The user has at most one here, and the platform resolves it from the session — no ids, no listings.

```sh
loops project get --event road-to-devcon-iv       # current state (exists=false if none yet)
loops project create --event road-to-devcon-iv --repoUrl <url>
loops project update --event road-to-devcon-iv --description "<new description>"
```

**The repo IS the entry**: create ONLY when a real GitHub repository exists to submit — the platform rejects a repo-less compete submission. Never create a placeholder entry "to fill in later"; the user then has to repair it by hand.

**Update is a PATCH**: only the fields you pass change — an update with just `--tagline` cannot wipe the repo URL. Fields: `--name`, `--tagline`, `--pitch`, `--description`, `--repoUrl`, `--demoUrl`, `--videoUrl`.

## Evaluate the project against a problem

Fetch a self-contained evaluator prompt for one problem (free; the platform attaches the user's project record), then **execute the prompt yourself inside the project repo** — it assumes the code access you have. The prompt walks that problem's brief, success criteria, and weighted judging criteria and returns alignment feedback: verified strengths, gaps, and where to focus. Run it for every problem the project targets, well before the deadline.

```sh
# Nobody Needs Your Aadhaar Number
loops evaluate --event road-to-devcon-iv --problem anon-aadhaar-one-person-one-claim

# Log In With a Wallet, Trust Only the Signature
loops evaluate --event road-to-devcon-iv --problem siwe-backend-verification

# A Seal of Belonging for Every Chaupal
loops evaluate --event road-to-devcon-iv --problem merkle-community-membership-seals
```

Report the feedback to the user, then apply agreed improvements via `loops project update`.
